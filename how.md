## The Challenge

<div>
{% for post in site.posts  %}
    {% if post.title contains "Kendall" %}           
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">“With Doctoral education, the goal is to have depth in something so the biggest piece is learning how to effectively communicate and collaborate across disciplines… Helping students navigate the heterogeneity from different disciplines. Another piece is helping them understand how a narrow topic connects to the broader world”</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer pb-0">Dr. Bruce Kendall</footer>
            </blockquote>
        </a>          
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

We know that communication and group work with people from diverse backgrounds are key components of interdisciplinary learning and research, but how do we logistically make this happen? Whether the goal is to teach an interdisciplinary course or creating a team of physical scientists, economists, and political scientists to investigate an environmental issue, there are several steps that can be taken to have a successful outcome. 

<div>
{% for post in site.posts  %}
    {% if post.title contains "Anderson" %}           
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">“I would train a student to have disciplinary depth and some exposure and experience with interdisciplinary work, ...it does not mean knowing how the model works exactly, but rather means having enough exposure to the language and the questions that are of interest in that discipline, to be able to effectively collaborate with people across disciplines."</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer pb-0">Dr. Sarah Anderson</footer>
            </blockquote>
        </a>          
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>



## Teaching

<div>
{% for post in site.posts  %}
    {% if post.title contains "Porter" %}           
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">“It's hard to imagine how you could teach that without being interdisciplinary.I try to weave in stories with my teaching to make the subject more memorable.”</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer pb-0">Dr. Susannah Porter</footer>
            </blockquote>
        </a>          
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

In a review of publications that cover teaching interdisciplinary in higher education, Spelt et al. found that important learning environment conditions include: having a balance between disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, and having deeper disciplinary knowledge. For the teacher, being highly experienced in interdisciplinarity, teaching within a community that supports it, and using teacher teams can facilitate the necessary understanding and integration of each other’s disciplines and create a safe environment for mentoring students. They also noted that in teaching an interdisciplinary course there needs to be an overarching goal: achieving interdisciplinary, achieving active learning, or achieving collaboration. 

William Newell lays out a further plan for teaching an interdisciplinary course in his book, Designing interdisciplinary courses. The steps to creating an undergraduate interdisciplinary course include:
1. Assembling an interdisciplinary team 
2. Selecting a topic 
3. Identifying disciplines
4. developing the subtext
5. Structuring the course
6. Selecting readings 
7. Designing assignments
8. Preparing the syllabus

In some cases, an interdisciplinary course comes together through commonalities in techniques. These would include courses in statistics, or GIS, where students from different backgrounds and disciplines need the tools to do their research.

            <p class="mb-0">“Multi or interdisciplinary works where there are obvious points of tangency, not just necessarily a problem that falls between them, but techniques that bridge the gap.”</p>
