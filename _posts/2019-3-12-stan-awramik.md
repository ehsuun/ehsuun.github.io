### How do you define interdisciplinary education?

Split up the word “interdisciplinary”
There are well-established disciplines in academic sphere. Interdisciplinarity is the combination of these disciplines to solve problems.
Trans-disciplinary

### How do you describe your teaching “field?” (as in research field)

I teach topics in depth, rather than a broad survey. Better to cover a few things in depth than a lot of this at surface-level.
Teach students the nature of science and how it works.

## What creates a successful interdisciplinary education experience?

Making students aware of the process of science
Interdisciplinarity is the reality, so just teach the reality.

## What do you hope students take away from a course?
Student leaves with appreciation of how integrated different sciences are.
Different scientists have different experiences/approaches that allow them to make contributions to field.

## Why do you believe the history of science is important to teach?
Demonstrates the function/nature science

## Do you feel that Earth Sci/STEM in general does a good enough job at interdisciplinary education?
History of science could be improved in other earth science courses.
