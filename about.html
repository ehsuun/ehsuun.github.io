    <p>
        We are a group of PhD students from University of California Santa Barbara. We came together over our interest in interdisciplinary education and research, and a class project leading to this website. As we developed this website we learned more about each other and how our disciplines overlap, giving us the interdisciplinary experience we are advocating for.
